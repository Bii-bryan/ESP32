RFID Door Authentication

The RFID Door Authentication Project is a system that allows authorized users to access a secured door using RFID tags. The system consists of three main components: an RFID reader, a microcontroller and a solenoid lock. The RFID reader scans the tags and sends the data to the microcontroller, which verifies the validity of the tag using a stored database. If the tag is valid, the microcontroller activates the solenoid lock and opens the door. The system also logs the date and time of each access attempt and displays it on an LCD screen. The system can be configured to allow different levels of access for different users and to set a time limit for opening the door.
